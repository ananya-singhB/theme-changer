# theme-changer

This small theme changer application allows users to switch between light and dark themes with a single button click. It uses React's context API for global theme management, enabling any component to access and modify the theme. The `Theme` component retrieves the current theme and toggles it when the button is clicked, updating both the buttonâ€™s label and styling accordingly. This demonstrates a smooth, interactive user experience while showcasing effective state management in React.
